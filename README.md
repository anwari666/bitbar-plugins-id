This repo contains my menubar utilities, aimed at Indonesian-related utils. At the moment it contains:

- CNN Indonesia's menu updater (cnnindonesia.5m.py). This requires `beautifulsoup`. Install using `pip` or your OS's package manager.
- Transferwise rate updater (transferwise.1m.py)

Expect more diverse and unified scripts coming in the near future.

## Installation
Just copy the plugin files (cnnindonesia.5m.py or transferwise.1m.py or both) to bitbar's plugins folder
