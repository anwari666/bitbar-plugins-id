This repo contains my menubar utilities, aimed at Indonesian-related utils. At the moment it contains:

## What's inside
- Deprecated: ~~CNN Indonesia's news updater (cnnindonesia.5m.py). This requires `beautifulsoup`. Install using `pip` or your OS's package manager~~. 
- Detik.com news updater (detikcom.5m.py). Same requirements as CNN Indonesia above
- Transferwise rate updater (transferwise.1m.py)

Expect more diverse and unified scripts coming in the near future.

## Installation
Just copy any of the plugin files (cnnindonesia.5m.py or transferwise.1m.py whatever) to your bitbar plugins' folder
